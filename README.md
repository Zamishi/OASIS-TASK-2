The "Guess the Number" game is an interactive Java application developed in Spring Tool Suite (STS), where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game is designed to provide an engaging and challenging experience, encouraging players to use logical deduction and feedback to reach the correct answer within a limited number of attempts.

Game Features:
Random Number Generation:

The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 at the start of each round, providing a unique challenge every time.
User Interaction:

Players input their guesses, and the game provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, helping guide the player toward the correct number.
Limited Attempts:

Players have a set number of attempts (e.g., 5) to guess the correct number, adding an element of strategy and pressure to each round.
Scoring System:

The game includes a scoring mechanism that awards points based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number. Fewer attempts result in higher scores, encouraging efficient guessing.
